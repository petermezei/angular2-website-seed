                <h2>General</h2>
                <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the

                <h2>Termination</h2>
                <p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability,
                for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.<br>
                All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity
                and limitations of liability.</p>
                <h2>Links To Other Websites</h2>

                by Slamby-Semantics Ltd.<br>

                content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites or services. You further
                acknowledge and agree that Slamby-Semantics Ltd. shall not be responsible or liable,

                <h2>Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Hungary (EU),
                without regard to its conflict of law provisions.<br>
                Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
                remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements
                we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
                <h2>Changes</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
                revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new
                terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.<br>
                By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to
                be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the
